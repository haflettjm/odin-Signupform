   # OdinSignupform

   This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6.

   ## Development server

   Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

   ## Code scaffolding

   Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

   ## Build

   Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

   ## Running unit tests

   Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

   ## Running end-to-end tests

   Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

   ## Further help

   To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
